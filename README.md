# Pleonastic Pronoun detection

This is the code used for the Bachelor thesis of [Bertelt Braaksma](mailto:b.braaksma.1@student.rug.nl). The aim of the research was to create a pleonastic pronoun detector, using a Random Forest Classifier. We trained the classifier on the SoNaR1 corpus. The program is a modified version of [the DutchCoref system](https://github.com/andreasvc/dutchcoref/).
